Sure! Let me explain both in a simple, intuitive way:

---

### ðŸ”¹ Deviation

* A **deviation** is how far a single data point is from the mean (average) of the dataset.
* It tells you: *"How much does this value differ from the average?"*
* Formula for deviation of a value $x_i$:

  $$
  d_i = x_i - \bar{x}
  $$

  where $\bar{x}$ is the mean.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Variance

* **Variance** measures how spread out the data is overall.
* It takes all the deviations, squares them (to make them positive), and averages them.
* So variance tells you: *"On average, how far are all the data points from the mean squared?"*
* Formula (for population variance):

  $$
  \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
  $$

For sample variance (if you're using a sample instead of full population), you divide by $N - 1$ instead of $N$.

### ðŸ”¹ Simple analogy:

Imagine the mean is a central point.

* **Deviation**: distance of one person from that point.
* **Variance**: average of the squared distances of EVERYONE from that point.

---

### Bonus: Standard Deviation

* Standard deviation is just the *square root* of variance.
* It brings the spread back to the original units (since variance is in squared units).

| Term               | Meaning                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Deviation          | One point's distance from the mean       |
| Variance           | Average of squared deviations (spread)   |
| Standard Deviation | Square root of variance (typical spread) |
