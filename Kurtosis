**Kurtosis** is a statistical measure that describes the *shape* of a distributionâ€™s tails compared to a normal distribution.
It tells you whether the data have *heavier or lighter tails* than a normal bell curve.

### **Formula**

For a dataset $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$:

$$
\text{kurtosis} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^4}{\left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \right)^2}
$$

* The numerator is the **fourth central moment** (measures extreme deviations).
* The denominator is the square of the variance.

### **Types**

* **Excess Kurtosis** = Kurtosis âˆ’ 3
  (Because a normal distribution has kurtosis = 3, excess kurtosis = 0 for normal.)

| Excess Kurtosis | Name            | Meaning                                  |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| > 0             | **Leptokurtic** | Heavier tails, more outliers than normal |
| = 0             | **Mesokurtic**  | Similar to normal distribution           |
| < 0             | **Platykurtic** | Lighter tails, fewer outliers            |

---

### **Interpretation**

* **High kurtosis (> 3)** â†’ data prone to extreme values (fat tails).
* **Low kurtosis (< 3)** â†’ data are more evenly distributed, fewer extreme values.
* **Exactly 3** (or excess = 0) â†’ shape similar to normal.

ðŸ’¡ Quick example in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

data = [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 100]  # has an extreme value
kurt = stats.kurtosis(data)  # excess kurtosis
print(kurt)  # > 0 means heavy-tailed
```

If you want, I can also give you a **visual example** comparing high, normal, and low kurtosis distributions so you see the difference. Would you like me to?
