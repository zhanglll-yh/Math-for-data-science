Maximum drawdown (MDD) measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in an investment's value over a specific period, expressed as a percentage. It’s a key risk metric in finance, showing the worst-case loss an investor could have experienced.

**Formula**:  
MDD = (Peak Value - Trough Value) / Peak Value × 100%

**Example**:  
If an investment grows to $10,000 (peak) and then drops to $7,000 (trough), the MDD is:  
($10,000 - $7,000) / $10,000 × 100% = 30%

**Key Points**:
- **Time Period**: MDD depends on the timeframe analyzed (e.g., daily, monthly, or entire history).
- **Use**: Helps assess risk tolerance, portfolio volatility, and strategy performance.
- **Limitations**: Doesn’t account for recovery time or frequency of drawdowns.
