### What is a Moving Average?

A **moving average** is a smoothing technique used to see the trend in data by averaging values over a fixed window that “moves” through the dataset.

### Imagine like this:

Suppose you want to know the "average temperature of the last 7 days", but you calculate this every day.

Example (window = 7 days):

* On Day 7 → average of Day 1 to Day 7
* On Day 8 → average of Day 2 to Day 8
* On Day 9 → average of Day 3 to Day 9
* ...and so on.

So the window keeps **sliding forward** (moving), dropping the old value and including the new value.

### Why use a moving average?

* To **smooth out noise** in data (remove random fluctuations).
* Make the **trend** easier to see.
* Often used in stock prices, weather data, time-series forecasting.

### One sentence definition:

> A moving average is the average of the last *N* points in your data, recalculated as you move forward through the series.

---

### Visualization (simple):

If your data is:
`[3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 8, 10, 11]`, and window = 3

Moving averages will be:

```
(3+5+7)/3 = 5   -> for positions [1-3]
(5+7+6)/3 = 6   -> for positions [2-4]
(7+6+4)/3 = 5.67 -> for positions [3-5]
...
```

Each new point takes the *last 3 numbers* and averages them.

### TL;DR

**Moving average** = smooth line created by averaging previous few values again and again.
It helps to see the pattern better and is used as a simple forecasting method.
